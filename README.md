To run the code, simply click the run button on the main.cpp file. This will start up the menu in the command line interface.

First, enter your selection based on whether you would like to view the N most commonly brute forced passwords, determine if a password is one of the 100,000 most commonly brute forced passwords, or exit the program.

Then it will ask for additional input on the number of passwords you would like to see for option 1, the password you would like to check and what data structure you would like to use for option 2, and stop the program for option 3. 

If searching through a data structure, it will also output an estimate of the amount of time it took to search for the specified value.

The program will continue automatically until told to exit.
